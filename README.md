# [Upscope.io](https://upscope.io/)'s REST API

With Upscope's REST API you can retrieve information about your account and your
users, as well as generate authorization tokens that allow unauthenticated users
to screen share with Upscope. This enables you to integrate Upscope within your
application and handle authentication however fits your needs.

Please note that our REST API is only available to our Enterprise customers.

## Authentication
To use our REST API, you will need a secret API key. If the API is enabled for
your account, you will find this in the
[general settings](https://app.upscope.io/settings/teams/_). You can only copy
the API key once before it is hidden. You will need to update the API key if you
lose access to it.

To authenticate your requests you will need to set a `X-Api-Key` header with
your API key as value.

If authorization is unsuccessful your request will fail.

### Authentication errors

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": "invalid_api_key"
}
```

| HTTP Code | Error | Meaning |
| --------- | ----- | ------- |
| 401 | `invalid_api_key` | The API key provided was not found / no API key was provided |
| 401 | `subscription_expired` | The team's subscription has now expired |
| 401 | `api_not_enabled` | The team's subscription does not include API access |

## Retrieving usage statistics
To get your account's current usage statistics, make a `GET` request to:
```
https://api.upscope.io/v1.0/usage.json
```

A response will look like this:

```json
{
  "usage": {
    "users": {
      "online_now": 100,
      "last_24_hrs": 1000,
      "last_30_days": 40000
    },
    "agents": {
      "today": 5,
      "last_30_days": 20
    },
    "session_counts": {
      "now": 3,
      "today": 30,
      "last_30_days": 100
    },
    "session_seconds": {
      "today": 400,
      "last_30_days": 10000
    }
  }
}
```

In this context, "session" means one screen sharing session.

  "users": [
